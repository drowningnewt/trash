## Chained Alternation

### Where are the high alternation layouts?
The maximization of alternation has been naturally avoided by the [AKL community](discord.gg/dvorak). Sure, many layouts with d/c or h on the vowel hand have gained popularity (Semimak JQ, NRTSHAEI, etc.), these layouts tend to have high alternation as a side effect of other factors. Maximization of alternation in an English keyboard layouts requires having t with vowels.

### Why is high alternation avoided in the first place?
While the [Layout Doc](https://bit.ly/layout-doc-v2) may say that alternation can "offer a more consistent typing experience, as it feels rhythmic and minimizes awkward sequences," many find that alternation can be limiting at high speeds. Theoretically, alternation can be faster than rolls, as one can type an ngram almost instantly. However, the challenge arises in the finger coordination required to execute this. Try typing `the` and `ing` on QWERTYâ€”most would likely say `ing` because `in` feels more like a fluid movement. That is the basis behind high roll layouts: rolls feel smooth and cohesive so why not maximize them?

### Why chained alternation over regular alternation?
I don't know. I was just bored.

### What does a high chained alternation layout look like?
I have developed two chained alternation layouts that are very similar:

### What makes these layouts high chained alternation?
- `t` + vowels
  - `ther` `thin` `they` `this`
- `g` + vowels
  - `_ing`
- General `cvcv` or `vcvc` patterns (v-vowel; c-consonant)
  - `some` `life` `come` `more` `love` `over`

### Are these layouts good?
Of course not. I made these layouts due to the lack of curiosity in high alternation layouts and thought this would be interesting to look into since I was already looking into tetragrams at the time. 
- `gt` column is poor for SFS
  - `ght` `get` `got`
- General scissors with `m`
  - `mb` `m_v` in both layouts
  - other worse ones in each individual layout
- High movement index columns
- Several redirects due to `t`
  - `tio` `ate` `ati` `it'` `ite` `eti`

## What about other layouts?
I have a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dnO0UmP8Z2AMtsdVwARkff7jo9a9p6bAopBAnXSM8lE/edit?usp=sharing) where I analyzed layouts I found interesting in all the tetragram stats I deemed significant enough for me to look into. The analysis is done in a modded version of genkey where tetragrams can be analyzed.
